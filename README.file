My Movies & TV Shows (React)

Brief
- A small React app to list favorite movies/TV shows, built with Vite.

Features
- View movies as cards (title, poster, description, rating).
- Add a new movie via a simple form (title, poster URL, rating, description).
- Filter the displayed list by title substring and minimum rating.

Files of interest
- `src/App.jsx` — main app: state, add-form, filtering logic.
- `src/components/MovieList.jsx` — renders the grid of movies.
- `src/components/MovieCard.jsx` — individual movie card.
- `src/components/Filter.jsx` — controls for title and rating filters.

Run
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open the local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Notes
- The app uses React hooks (`useState`) for state management.
- Changes are not persisted (no localStorage) — I can add that if you want.
